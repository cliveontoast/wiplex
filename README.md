Windows phone living image video extractor for LI.jpg files

Run the Build-and-test.bat file to compile and test the program.

Now you can run bin\wiplex.exe from the command line. Pass the argument of the directory containing many of your living image pictures.

i.e.
wiplex.exe "C:\Users\Clive\OneDrive\Documents\Pictures\Camera Roll"

It will create video.mp4 files for any videos it finds.
